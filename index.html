						<div class="drive2">It is with a heavy heart that we announce the 2020 WKC Graduation Banquet and Event has officially been cancelled.<br>We have received confirmation from Evraz that they are unable to allow the event to happen due to the health restrictions still in place.<br>Since we can no longer host the event all tickets will be fully refunded.<br>If you paid for your tickets via an e-transfer, you will receive your refund via e-transfer.  If a security question is required for us to do the e-transfer, we will set it so the password is wkcgrad.<br>If you paid cash for your tickets, we will be reaching out to you via the email and/or phone number provided on the Ticket Purchase Form to set up the refund.<br>Note – if you purchased additional tickets once we opened up the number of tickets allowed (so made two separate payments) we will be refunding the whole amount in one transaction.<br>This is going to take us a bit of time to get through everyone so please be patient.  If you have not heard from us by the end of June, then please reach out to us via email at WKCGradEvent@outlook.com.<br><br><br><b>So now on a positive note!</b><br><br>With the fundraising that was done we are we do have some money left over and we are planning to put that money back towards something for the graduates.  We do not have any details at this time and are still trying to figure out what can be done while staying within the Provincial Health restrictions for group gatherings but we are working on a few ideas and possibilities.<br>Keep watching our website, Facebook page and Instagram for updates.  Hopefully we can pull something informal and fun together for anyone who is interested and able to attend.<br><br></div>
