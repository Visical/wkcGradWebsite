We are optimistic that by the time our event date arrives this current situation will have passed.  Since this event is run by a parent based, volunteer committee we have no connections to the Regina Public Schools or the decisions they are making.<br><br>
                             We will keep everyone posted via our website and social media accounts as we learn anything more that could affect this event.<br><br>
                             In the meantime, we hope that everyone stays safe and follows the recommendations set out by our governments and health officials to assist in the slowing of this pandemic so that the least number of people are affected by it.<br>

					<h1> Grad Committee </h1>
                    <p>Welcome to the WKC 2020 Graduation Banquet website! This event is organized and run by parent volunteers who want all grade 12 students to have the opportunity to attend a celebration culminating their time from pre-school to grade 12. We want these students to celebrate their success with family and friends.</p>
                    <p>The parent volunteers will work hard this next year to put on a memorable evening for students and families. Please help us spread the word to other WKC grade 12 families about this website as it will be a great place to find information about the event, fundraising, tickets and pictures from the banquet.</p>
