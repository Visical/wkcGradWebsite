                        WKC Graduation 2020 Formal Event</h2>
						<div class="drive2">This event is FREE to all WKC 2020 Grade 12 Graduates!  It is a chance for graduates to get together with all their classmates one last time.  There will be a group photo on the front steps, a Grand March across the stage, speeches and areas set up to take photos with your friends to celebrate the culmination of all your hard work over the past 12 years.<br><br>
                        Details will follow but we anticipate the event to start between 6:00pm and 7:00pm and then end around 10:30pm.  We wanted to get the word out so that everyone can start planning for the event.<br><br>
                        Due to Sask Health Authority restrictions and the number of people allowed to be together inside a building, this event is ONLY for the graduates; no parents, no guests, no escorts.  We are working with the Conexus Arts Center to set up live streaming of the event.  We also have photographers attending to take photos of everyone as they cross the stage which will then be made available to download from the website.<br><br>
                        Final itinerary of the event will be posted on this website as soon as itâ€™s finalized. You can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram for updates.</div>
